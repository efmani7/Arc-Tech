        <p>ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES Apple today previewed Apple Al Maryah Island, a new retail destination elevated
          above steps of cascading water. The new store creates a direct connection from The Galleria Al Maryah Island to the water’s edge,
          delivering the best of Apple with shoreline views amid Abu Dhabi’s prestigious financial district.

        <p>Apple Al Maryah Island introduces several new design elements reflective of its surroundings. From the promenade, two ramps paved with Absolute Black granite stone — the first use of this material at any Apple Store — cut
          through water and continue seamlessly inside the store, blurring the barrier between inside and out. The store also features a golden carbon fiber roof locally sourced in the UAE. Visitors entering from The Galleria Al Maryah Island Mall
          will walk through a mirrored stainless steel portal, enveloped by the sights and sounds of water jets cascading over exterior glass walls. A 72-foot-long mirrored foil ceiling creates a kaleidoscopic effect, with water falling down the
          walls, and
          reflections seen above.

        <h3>GPU prices are now dropping below MSRP</h3>
        <br>
        <p>PRESS RELEASE | May 5, 2022</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <div class="newstext">


          <p>With the GPU industry stabilizing after two years of shortages and inflated costs, prices for graphics cards
            are finally approaching their manufacturer’s suggested retail prices (MSRPs). In some cases, though, certain
            boards are now available for a price that is below their recommended retail price tags. Case in point: The AMD
            Radeon 6900XT Gaming OC model can now be purchased for $50 below the official MSRP.</p>

        </div>

          <div class="footer">

          </div>


          <div class="newstext">
            <p>As reported by Tom’s Hardware, the Gigabyte RX 6900XT Gaming OC is currently being
              sold by U.S. online retailer Newegg for $949. That’s a $50 drop from AMD’s $999 MSRP
              for this specific range of video cards.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>

          <div class="newstext">
            <p>Interestingly, though, Newegg has actually listed a $50 rebate on top of the price
              reduction, which means you can pick up a powerful AMD gaming video card for $899.
              If you read that last sentence before 2022, you’d automatically assume it’s either
              a scam, defective product, typo, or a flat-out lie.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>

          <div class="newstext">
            <p>Since the pandemic began in 2020 that kickstarted the chip shortage, coupled with
              bottlenecked supply chains, current-gen AMD and Nvidia graphics cards have been almost
              impossible to buy at MSRP. In fact, Tom’s Hardware notes that at one point during 2021
              average GPU prices were above a staggering $1,000. Even last-gen boards saw scalpers
              and re-sellers listing them for hundreds of dollars above their original price.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>

          <div class="newstext">
            <p>AMD, Nvidia, scalpers, crypto miners, and board partners for Team Green/Team Red all
              saw their bottom line increasing by a significant margin. Asus even reportedly handed
              out huge bonuses thanks to the amount of money it was generating from graphics cards. Cards
              like the RX 6900XT, regardless of the model, were consistently listed for well above $1,000
              on 3rd-party marketplaces, at least throughout 2021. In April, Tom’s Hardware highlighted
              that this AMD GPU was being offered for an average price of $1,256 on platforms like eBay.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>

          <div class="newstext">
            <h3>Price drops across the board. But why?</h3>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>

          <div class="newstext">
            <p>As for the Newegg listing of the Gigabyte RX 6900XT Gaming OC, that $950 price point
              (without the rebate) is a $300 discount from what is was being sold for in recent months. So why
              are online marketplaces aggressively dropping the prices across the board for some of the most popular
              graphics cards? There are a few reasons to consider. First, it was already a foregone conclusion that
              prices will start to normalize around May — a scenario that was previously emphasized by a U.K. retailer.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>

          <div class="newstext">
            <p>Second, you have to remember that it wasn’t just scalpers who were selling GPUs at inflated costs.
              Retailers — and indeed Nvidia/AMD board partners themselves — generated significant revenue and profits due
              to the unprecedented demand and shortage.</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>

          <div class="newstext">
            <p>If consumers were still buying these video cards at a level above their MSRP, you would not be seeing
              price drops anywhere. Retailers, by all accounts, have seen demand levels return to normal and therefore
              have plenty of excess stock.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>

          <div class="newstext">
            <h3>Next-gen is nearly here</h3>
          </div>

          <br>
          <br>

          <div class="newstext">
            <p>Finally, there are only a few months left before the arrival of next-gen GPUs. These products are shaping
              up to be some of the most exciting pieces of technology that we’ve ever seen, at least where graphics cards
              are concerned. Many will simply choose to wait it out before paying nearly $1,000 for any GPU when they can
              put that money towards an upgraded version.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>


          <div class="newstext">
            <p>Here’s where things start to get a bit more interesting and exciting. The current-gen RDNA 2 AMD Radeon
              RX 6900XT, as mentioned above, retails for $999. However, the next-gen RDNA 3 successor is rumored to offer
              similar performance levels to the former at a price between $399 and $499.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>


          <div class="newstext">
            <p>The cost for current-gen boards will also naturally decline once their successors hit the market, so consumers
              will be waiting for that state of affairs to materialize as well. Nvidia is even contemplating selling its RTX 30-series
              alongside the RTX 40 range so finding one won’t be a problem.
            </p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>


          <div class="newstext">
            <p>All things considered, expect to see AMD and Nvidia graphics cards across the board moving closer to their MSRPs, or even
              dropping below it, in the near future. Elsewhere, Tom’s Hardware notes that we should anticipate additional price reductions
              for GPUs from the Radeon RX 6000-series — the upgraded RX 6×50 RDNA 2 refresh is reportedly set to become available in the coming weeks.

              <p>The Nintendo Switch is a console that does a lot of things all at once. L
                ike the motion controls of the Wii, or the glasses-free 3D of the Nintendo 3DS,
                or the experimental second screen of the Wii U, the Switch's innovative hybrid design
                has helped Nintendo to continue to blaze its own trail and do something different. In the
                three years since its launch, the Nintendo Switch has become a true gaming hit—every holiday
                season it's one of the most popular devices around, and as social distancing rules have
                taken effect during the coronavirus pandemic it's become a firm favorite with gamers and
                non-gamers alike.
              </p>

            <br>

            <div class="newstext">
              <p>A large part of the Nintendo Switch's success is its hybrid design which has allowed it to
                bridge the gap between handheld console and home console in a totally unique way.
              </p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <div class="newstext">
              <p>The way that the Nintendo Switch combines gaming on-the-go and gaming at home, making each a
                delight in its own way, is a credit to Nintendo's team. With its ever-growing library of exclusive
                first-party games and top-tier third-party titles, the Nintendo Switch is a better proposition than ever.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="newstext">
              <p>Whether you've already made your purchase or not, you have to agree that the Nintendo Switch is a fine
                idea, mixing together some of what made the Wii and Wii U appealing for gamers (even if developers had a
                harder time figuring out how to make the most of the latter device).
              </p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <div class="newstext">
              <p>The Nintendo Switch brings with it a central idea that can benefit literally every game, not just the select
                few that can use motion control or a second screen. Who hasn't at one time wanted to pack up their console and
                take it with them?</p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <div class="newstext">
              <p>Largely, the Switch delivers very well on this hybrid idea. You'll find it a solid, premium-feeling handheld,
                which can then flip into docked mode and work more or less as you'd expect a home console to, if and when needed.</p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <div class="newstext">
              <p>At the same time, the Nintendo Switch certainly isn't perfect: most of the issues it has are a consequence of
                the way that it dares to try and do everything at once, and it doesn't always get the compromise right.
              </p>

            <br>

            <div class="newstext">
              <p>Those who aren't sold on its hybridity and just want that classic Nintendo handheld experience will no doubt
                be interest in the compact, lighter alternative: the Nintendo Switch Lite, which offers a solely handheld
                Switch gaming experience.

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>In the box with your shiny new Nintendo Switch you get the main console, two detachable controller sides (Joy-Cons), a
                  grip which enables you to combine these controller portions into a more traditional gamepad, two straps which can make
                  them into two individual controllers, and a dock for plugging the console into your television. </p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>You also get a USB Type-C power cable (with a non-detachable power brick) and an HDMI cable for connecting the device to your TV. </p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>If you think that sounds like a lot of accessories then you'd be right: we suspect a lot of Nintendo Switch owners will have misplaced at
                  least one or two of these within the space of a few months.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>We've taken to wrapping our Joy-Con straps around our Joy-Con grip just to keep everything together, but we'd love some way of attaching
                  them to the console so they don't end up getting misplaced.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>It's a pretty novel (not to mention somewhat complicated) setup, so it's worth delving into each of the different ways you can use the console.</p>

                <p>Setting up a brand new Nintendo Switch is refreshingly simple, you'll be pleased to learn.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>If you're using the device as a handheld, simply attach the Joy-Cons, press the power button,
                  and... er... that's it.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>If you want to play Nintendo Switch games on your TV, you need to plug the dock into the TV via HDMI,
                  then hook it up to some power via the included USB Type-C power lead. The console then easily slips
                  into the dock.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>Pairing the controllers is a little more complicated than with other devices because of the fact
                  that they can either be paired or used separately. The way you tell the Switch which controllers you're
                  using is to press both the L and R shoulder buttons in whichever configuration you've opted for.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>So if you're using the Joy-Cons individually, you press the buttons on the Joy-Con straps to indicate
                  that this is the case. </p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>On the software side, the console asks for the standard combination of Wi-Fi details and user account
                  set-up info. These details are a doddle to input on the console's touchscreen – the keyboard isn't quite
                  as good as a phone's but it's much better than a typical console experience.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">

                <p>The iPhone 14 might be the smallest upgrade we've seen Apple introduce in a long time - but
                  the iPhone 14 Pro could be the biggest, as leaks point to the Pro models getting an
                  incredible revamp.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>We've heard about four new iPhone 14 models in total, with the Pro and Pro Max variants
                  tipped to get new features like an Always-On Display, higher-res rear camera, redesigned front
                  camera cut-out and more. None of this is official, so take it with a pinch of salt, but there's
                  been lots of corroboration in what leakers expect.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>We have a surprisingly clear picture of the form the iPhone 14 range might take – though this
                  far from launch we’d be extra skeptical, as there’s plenty of time for things to change.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>But the rumors so far are promising, pointing to a completely new design for the iPhone 14 Pro
                  and iPhone 14 Pro Max, a totally new model dubbed the iPhone 14 Max, and some significant
                  camera upgrades.</p>

                <p>One place we might hear something is at WWDC 2022, which is taking place today. While Apple is
                  almost certainly not going to announce anything related to the iPhone 14 – it usually saves those
                  announcements for later in the year – this could be the year it decides to mix things up. Regardless
                  of what it announces though – be it an iPhone or not – be sure to follow along with our WWDC

                <p>iPhone 14 release date: There aren't any release date rumors yet, we've heard about the launch event: it could take place on
                  September 13. Expect a release about a week after the debut.</p>

              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>Design: The iPhone 14 will probably look a lot like the iPhone 13, but the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max could get a punch-hole
                  camera instead of a notch. There might also be a big-screen iPhone 14 Max in place of an iPhone 14 mini.</p>

                  iPhone 14 Pro Max could have 6.7-inch (or 6.68-inch) 1284 x 2778 OLED screens. Expect a 120Hz refresh rate on the Pro models and
                  a 60Hz refresh rate on the others.</p>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>Camera: The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max could have 48MP main cameras (up from 12MP on the current models). Other specs are
                  unclear, but a triple-lens snapper on all but the standard iPhone 14 is likely, with the basic phone instead having two rear lenses.</p>

              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>Specs: Every iPhone 14 model is expected to have a powerful A16 Bionic chipset, but the Pro models could additionally have 8GB of RAM
                  (up from a maximum of 6GB currently) and up to 2TB of storage (up from a current maximum of 1TB). Some rumors suggest the iPhone 14 and 14
                  Max could stick with last year's A15 Bionic though.</p>

                <p>The iPhone 13 was unveiled on September 14, 2021, and it shipped on September 24. While we probably won’t see the iPhone 14 on those exact
                  dates in 2022, Apple tends to unveil the new models on either the first or second Tuesday in September, which would mean either
                  September 6 or September 13.</p>

                <p>We've heard one iPhone 14 price leak which detailed four members of the new range - with a Max included, but no Mini.</p>

              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>Apparently the base phone will start at $799 - the iPhone 13 starts at $799 / £779 / AU$1,349, so that fits - with the iPhone 14 Max going for
                  $100 more than that. We've similarly elsewhere heard that the iPhone 14 will have a similar starting price to the iPhone 13.</p>

                <p>The biggest news on the iPhone 14’s design comes from one big leak, which includes unofficial renders of the iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>You can see one of these below, and it includes a punch-hole camera instead of a notch, with the Face ID components presumably being under
                  the screen. It also doesn’t really have a camera bump, with the lenses sitting almost flat on the back – a thing that is apparently
                  achieved by making the phone thicker.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>The back is a semi-glossy glass, the volume buttons are shown to be round, and it apparently has titanium sides, in place of stainless steel
                  on the iPhone 13 Pro Max. You can also see that there’s still a triple-lens camera and a Lightning port.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>The colors shown here aren’t official (though the source claims to have seen a rose gold model), and it’s worth also noting that this design
                  is thought to only apply to the Pro models, with the iPhone 14 (and iPhone 14 Max if there is one) likely to still have a notch. It’s not currently
                  clear which if any of the other design details here could make it to the standard models.</p>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>We would of course take this with a huge helping of salt, especially as it comes from Jon Prosser, who has a mixed track record, and as another
                  source has said the iPhone 14 Pro range will still have a notch (albeit a smaller one) - possibly as well as a punch-hole.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>But Prosser is often right, and both Mark Gurman and Ming-Chi Kuo (two leakers with excellent track records for Apple information) have since
                  said that the notch will be replaced with a punch-hole camera, as more recently has The Elec.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>Another leaker has chimed in to say the same too, though they claim that the camera cut-out will be pill-shaped, suggesting that it might be
                  bigger than most punch-hole cameras.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>Ross Young - a supply-chain expert in the world of smartphone displays - has said he believes the company will adopt a "hole + pill" design of
                  the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. That will mean a pill-shaped cutout, as well as a smaller hole that will still be visible – a theory
                  backed up with a leaked schematic cut out.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>More sources have now agreed with this, and leaked CAD renders visible below show this design too, though they don't show the rear camera
                  changes you can see further up.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>In fact, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max might actually have a slightly bigger camera bump than the iPhone 13 Pro range according to leaked
                  schematics. This is reportedly due to the use of a new 48MP sensor (more on which further down).</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>All that said, Gurman has said the iPhone 14 range will include “a hole-punch-sized notch”, and it's not clear from that whether he means
                  a small notch or an actual punch-hole, so there's still some uncertainty about the design.</p>
              </div>
              <br>

              <div class="newstext">
                <p>Elsewhere, we’ve heard that the Pro models could use a titanium alloy for their frame. This would likely be stronger than the materials
                  used in current models, and this source also claims there will be an iPhone 14 Max in place of an iPhone 14 mini.</p>

                      using very little power, like creating music with layers of effects or applying complex filters
                      to photos.1 Compared with the latest 10-core PC laptop chip, the CPU in M2 provides nearly twice
                      the performance at the same power level. And, M2 delivers the peak performance of the PC chip while
                      using just a quarter of the power.2 When compared to the latest 12-core PC laptop chip — which needs
                      dramatically more power to deliver an increase in performance and is therefore found in thicker, hotter,
                      more noisy systems with less battery life — M2 provides nearly 90 percent of the peak performance of
                      the 12-core chip while using just one-fourth the power.3</p>

                      <p>Where most graphics cards support up to four displays, it seems the upcoming Intel Arc Alchemist
                        (DG2) GPU is rocking an unusual fifth display port – though not seems to be known about it, or indeed,
                        what kind of connection it will require to work. The discovery was initially made by Phoronix
                        (though the report has since been deleted)(opens in new tab) within the notes of a Linux Driver Patch(opens in new tab),
                        written by Intel engineer Matt Roper. At the start of the patch notes, Roper writes that "DG2 supports a
                        5th display output, which the hardware refers to as 'TC1,' even though it isn't a Type-C output.
                        This behaves similarly to the TC1 on past platforms with just a couple of minor differences".</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="newstext">
                      <p>No additional information is provided within the notes, so it's currently unclear if this will be a
                        connection that is exclusively compatible with USB-C displays, though as TomsHardware(opens in new tab)
                        notes in its own report, all of the DG2 prototypes that have been spotted only have the standard four outputs.
                        It's possible that this mysterious fifth connection could be restricted to a specialist version of the card,
                        and leaked images shouldn't be wholly trusted prior to a product release.</p>

                    <div class="newstext">
                      <p>Given Roper states that the GPU refers to the port as a TC1 (USB Type C) and mentions it will behave similarly
                        to older versions of the connection while not actually being a Type-C output, it's unclear if a traditional
                        USB-C display or dock can actually be used. </p>

                      <p>Most modern graphics cards have DisplayPort and HDMI ports, but TC ports are able to route DisplayPort
                        signals to other connections like Thunderbolt. We have reached out to Intel for some clarification.</p>

                        feature that never leaves testing stages, or as mentioned, be restricted to a small release of
                        products designed for specialist use.</p>

                        of their launch, and now we have news from the chip giant itself that the discrete graphics cards
                        won’t arrive any time soon for regions outside of China.This is disappointing, of course, but not
                        exactly a surprise given that over the past couple of weeks, it’s been looking more and more likely
                        that Arc Alchemist desktop products were going to slip going by the rumor mill. What’s really dismaying
                        here is how far they may have potentially slipped for regions outside of Asia.</p>

                        and retail component sales will follow shortly in China as well. Proximity to board components and
                        strong demand for entry-level discrete products makes this a natural place to start. Our next step will
                        be to scale these products globally.</p>

                        on pricing – and who’d been promised a Q2 launch for these discrete Arc GPUs. And yes, Intel again underlined

                        mention of such an approach, or a staggering on a regional basis (or a staggering of OEMs then standalone cards,

                      <p>Pearce also says the following as a kind of excuse for the delay: “Unlike notebook designs, desktop systems have a
                        vast set of combinations, including memory, motherboards, and CPUs. To initially limit some of this variation, we will
                        launch working with system builders and OEMs with specific configurations.”</p>

                      <p>While that’s true enough, it’s not like Intel suddenly realized this, at this point in the Arc desktop development process.
                        So why all the bluster about a Q2 launch – which was taken as read as being global – always being in the cards if the company
                        knew the complexities around making the desktop products were continuing to be a thorny problem.</p>

                      <p>We – and many others – have speculated for a while now that Intel is needing extra time to nail the drivers, and there’s also a
                        mention of software issues in the post, albeit relating to sluggish availability of laptop GPUs. Again, the situation with those mobile
                        Arc graphics cards was that they launched in Q1 (just), but have only been available in Korea thus far – sound familiar? – with
                        Pearce noting that Intel has “had some software readiness delays” which have contributed to delaying wider global availability of
                        Arc-powered notebooks (plus Covid lockdowns are in the mix here, too).</p>

                        cards will only be purchased as part of a prebuilt PC. Retail sales of standalone graphics cards will “follow shortly”, so let’s say that’ll
                        be late July (or maybe early August).</p>

                        seems to suggest there could be a little bit of a wait after the launch of Arc GPUs in prebuilt desktops. If the latter is happening late in August,
                        then, we can guess September would be labeled as ‘soon’, so we’re most likely looking at October as a best-case scenario of standalone Arc GPUs

                        so September or October time – and both are expected to make some serious performance leaps. (Nvidia is purportedly ramping up frame rates massively, admittedly

                        anyway, or so we’ve heard – is currently rumored to trade blows with Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti, and so it might end up squaring off against more like the RTX
                        4060, which, er, isn’t a good look for Team Blue (in terms of flagship equals mid-range).</p>

                      <p>Surely, if that’s the case, pricing will then become the only viable way Intel can attack the market, particularly considering it’s looking like GPU availability
                        issues are easing already – meaning prices are normalizing – and inventory issues could have largely evaporated completely as we roll towards the end of 2022
                        (so gamers won’t be scrabbling for any vaguely palatable stock they can get their hands on in certain price segments).</p>

                        grapevine thus far doesn’t seem to suggest that’s the case…</p>

                            then you know that Dell played a leading rol (and you also probably recall Dell’s now-famous
                            TV ad campaigns). Age hasn’t slowed the brand down a bit, however, and in 2022, Dell is still
                            busy rolling out many of the best laptops that money can buy. Whether you need a machine for
                            work, gaming, or just general everyday use, Dell has a laptop with your name on it, and we’re
                            here to help you find it at a price you’re willing to pay. Here, we’ve rounded up all the best

                        <div class="newstext">
                          <p>The great thing about being one of the best laptop brands is that Dell knows how to deliver the
                            best value you’ll find in a portable PC. In the case of the Dell Inspiron 15 3000, it’s easily one
                            of the best Dell laptops for anyone on a tight budget. It offers all the essentials while still
                            looking sharp. At its heart is an Intel processor along with 4GB of memory and a 128GB solid-state
                            drive. That might be on the basic side, but it’s a great deal at this price. It offers a good amount
                            of value with sufficient power and storage space for your most important files. Alongside that is a
                            great screen for the price. It has a 15.6-inch HD display with a refresh rate of 60Hz. It also has
                            nice narrow bezels so you get a sleeker look and less bulk, plus it has an anti-glare finish so it’s
                            easier on your eyes.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="newstext">
                          <p>The Dell Inspiron 15 3000 isn’t just about the obvious hardware features though. For instance, its
                            keyboard is surprisingly great. The laptop has a numeric keypad, 6.4% larger keycaps than previous models,
                            and a spacious touchpad so you can get plenty done on it without the hassle that can come from smaller or less
                            well-designed laptops. There’s also the inclusion of Dell Comfort View Low Blue Light Software, which reduces
                            harmful blue light emissions and optimizes your eye comfort even when you’ve been using it for a long period of time.
                            For the environmentally conscious, the laptop also uses post-consumer recycled plastics to make it more sustainable with
                            all painted parts using low VOC waterborne paint. Even the packaging is made from 100% recycled paper.</p>

                          <p>Offering many of the features you’d expect to see on the best gaming laptops, the Dell G15 is a great budget-priced
                            gaming system. It has an AMD Ryzen 7 processor powering the show, along with 8GB of memory and a 512GB SSD. That’s a nice
                            upgrade from your typical 128GB-256GB hard drives, and should provide ample space to install the games you’re playing along
                            with some of your all-time favorites you can’t live without. Alongside all that is an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphics
                            card which is great for playing the latest titles at good settings, and is an excellent GPU to see at this price point.</p>

                          <p>Another highlight of the Dell G15 is its screen. It has a 15.6-inch full HD display with an impressive refresh rate of 120Hz.
                            That means that action is silky smooth even when the game you’re playing gets fairly fast-paced. It also offers 250 nits of brightness
                            along with narrow borders so it looks great and isn’t too chunky, even for a gaming machine. Anti-glare functionality and Dell’s Comfort
                            View Plus software ensures that eyestrain is a thing of the past, too, even if you end up playing for hours
                            on end (which we know you will).</p>

                          <p>The Dell G15 is also intelligently designed when it comes to cooling. Its dual-fan thermal system uses copper piping to dissipate heat
                            meaning your laptop can cope with some heavy-duty gaming. Game Shift technology can trigger a dynamic performance mode too, maximizing
                            the fans’ speed to keep your system cool at all times. Other features include dual speakers with 3D audio and the Alienware
                            Command Center app for plenty of additional functionality. It’s a great way of gaining many of the benefits of
                            Alienware technology without paying the same premium.</p>

                            for a great system for working on the move while enjoying great looks and a lightweight build, you need the Dell XPS 13. It has an 11th-generation
                            Intel Core i7 processor along with 16GB of RAM, plus 512GB of solid-state storage. That’s all you need to get stuff done on the go, whether you’re

                          <p>The display is a 13.3-inch 1080p screen which is the perfect size for working on the go, but doesn’t feel small thanks to that edge-to-edge design.
                            InfinityEdge technology means that there are basically no bezels to look at, ensuring this is a super sleek interface that won’t leave you staring at
                            ugly screen borders or carrying around unnecessary bulk. Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics even allow for some entertainment, such as a little

                            to carry around while still offering plenty of power. It has 100% sRGB color and a 1500:1 contrast ratio with even the darkest and brightest of scenes
                            being crystal clear. 400 nits of brightness means it works just as well outdoors with a wide viewing angle helping you see more. its great built-in
                            webcam is smaller than that of previous models while offering sharper video, plus you get a keyboard that feels great under your fingertips. Everything

                            of space too soon. This Dell XPS 15 model even tosses in a dedicated graphics card in the form of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti. If you’re keen to get

                            Other great features include HDR support with Dolby Vision, so you get dark colors up to 10 times deeper and light colors up to 40 times brighter, which
                            is ideal when gaming and streaming your entertainment.</p>
